#COMMENT ON CHART
#based on the xbar chart, there are samples lie beyond the upper and lower control limit.Hence, we can conclude
#that the process is out of control.However, the R chart does not shows any irregularities that is 
#all samples lie inside the boundaries of control limits.
#In conclusion, we can say that there are possibility that the process is out of control based on the xbar chart.

#this occurrence might be due to the same assignable causes due to the sample 14th has the same pattern from graph.

#ESTIMATE PROCESS CAPABILITY (purpose : to understand the chance of non-comforming products that will be produced.)
